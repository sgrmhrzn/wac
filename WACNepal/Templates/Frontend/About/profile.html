It has made plan to go over far and Mid-Western districts of the country within five years. The Human Development Index of Achham District is 0.325 and it ranks 69 in 75 districts of Nepal; Gender Development Index (GDI) of Achham is 0.275. All other remaining districts of the region is similar in HDI and GDI index. All are hill districts where geography is rough and access is difficult. Social discrimination and low economic status is the common issues of them. Agriculture based economy of the districts have entrenched problems such as monsoon fed irrigation, lack of agricultural equipments and materials, inaccessibility of market and lack of basic infrastructure. The family size of the districts is more than five in comparison to their earnings. The majority of the population in working districts areBhramin and Chhetri including ethnic and minority groups.
                Female literacy rate and other developmental indexes are lower than male. The disparity between upper class and lower class is high as national figure. Unlike national average, rural population is more than 90% in these districts, which is also one major indicators of underdevelopment.
                Overall literacy rate of the districts is less than 45percent. Children have to walk in mountainous and dangerous slopes to reach schools, which are overcrowded, with insufficient teachers and other basic student facilities. Many schools and health posts lack proper infrastructure ; the clear drinking water facilities and road head access are the far away to reach the targeted community, donkey, sheepetc are the main means of transportation to deliver the goods and equipments to many district of the regions.
                
                <br /><br />The mortality rate of the area is below the rate of national level. The health posts are lacking the health worker. Junior levels of staff are chandellingseniors in some of the cases, ambulances are not easily accessible for the people. They have to use DOKOas stretcher (DOKO as a means of transporting patients to the nearest health clinics.) Medicines are not sufficient virtually no exist in the clinics. Due to low income, people cannot afford expensive medicines. So, the people are at the hand of nature for their life. The health service centers are not sufficient with the comparison of size of the population. Only one hospital is serving to entire population of district. Health posts and sub health posts have neither sufficient equipments nor medicines to serve local people.
                <br /><br />Migration for livelihood, poverty, malnutrition, ill-health condition, food deficit and social discrimination are the common issues of the all far-west and mid-west region.
